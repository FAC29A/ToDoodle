# Sections to Include

## Title

- [x] Write a Title

## Description

- [ ] Write a couple of sentences to explain exactly what the project is
  - Don't minimise it
- Examples
  - Example 1: Zipzod
     > This is zipzod! A command-line tool for zipping and unzipping files with an ultra low memory footprint.
  - Example 2: [go-rabbitmq](https://github.com/wagslane/go-rabbitmq)
     > Wrapper of rabbitmq/amqp091-go that provides reconnection logic and sane defaults
  - Example 3: [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
     > The fun, functional and stateful way to build terminal apps.
     > A Go framework based on The Elm Architecture.
     > Bubble Tea is well-suited for simple and complex terminal applications, either inline, full-window, or a mix of both.
- [ ] Include a screenshot
  - [ ] Make notes from the [bubbletea repo](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)

## Why?

- [ ] Write a paragraph or two to describe why someone should care about your project.
   - This is about the Motivation/Goal/Problem to Solve
   - The description section was about the "what", this is the "why".
   - Template
      > I had problem A and I tried B but it didn't work because C. I built D and now I can do E with ease!
   - Examples
      - Example 1: Zipzod
         > There are a lot of ways to zip and unzip files, but none of them use so little memory!
         > Zipzod is the zipping tool you need for working on low-memory devices like Raspberry Pis.
         > I use a Raspberry Pi as a home server, and I was frustrated by my inability to easily manage large files on a small device, so I built zipzod.
      - Example 2: [htmx](https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx)
         > * Why should only <a> and <form> be able to make HTTP requests?
         > * Why should only click & submit events trigger them?
         > * Why should only GET & POST be available?
         > * Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen?
         > 
         > By removing these arbitrary constraints htmx completes HTML as a hypertext
      - Example 3: [python-websockets](https://github.com/python-websockets/websockets)
         > The development of websockets is shaped by four principles:
         > 
         > * Correctness: websockets is heavily tested for compliance with RFC 6455. Continuous integration fails under 100% branch coverage.
         > * Simplicity: all you need to understand is msg = await ws.recv() and await ws.send(msg). websockets takes care of managing connections so you can focus on your application.
         > * Robustness: websockets is built for production. For example, it was the only library to handle backpressure correctly before the issue became widely known in the Python community.
         > * Performance: memory usage is optimized and configurable. A C extension accelerates expensive operations. It's pre-compiled for Linux, macOS and Windows and packaged in the wheel format for each system and Python version.
