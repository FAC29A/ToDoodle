// select the form/input/result

//Ideas for how to create list?
// tasks could be added to an array
//(array.push to add and array.splice to remove?)
// (this could be a table? Each time we add something we add 
// a <tr>? Or could declare variable n and every time
// submit is pressed, add to <tr>[n] then n+1)

//Function for adding tasks
// when submit is pressed add it to list 

//Function to remove tasks

//Function for complete tasks
// When complete, get added to different list/ gets a .hidden 
// class added to the class list? 

//Function for toggling between all/to do either with class list
// or filter function?
// Toggle between 'all' and 'to do'
